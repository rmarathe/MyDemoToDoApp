# MyToDoApp

This is a demo of my first Android application called MyToDoApp. 

An app which enabes you to build a "To Do List" and maintain it by being able to perform baisc operatons like adding an item to it, removing an item from the list and editing an existing item. Also, upon closing the app, most recently updated list is saved and is made available upon reopening the app.
